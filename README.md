## 📊 Project Overview

This is an intelligent **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)** web application that detects malicious activity in network traffic using **machine learning**. It integrates:

- ✅ **Supervised anomaly detection** using XGBoost
- ✅ **MITRE ATT&CK** tagging to map attack behavior
- ✅ **Explainable AI (SHAP)** to show *why* something was flagged
- ✅ **Interactive dashboard** built with Streamlit
